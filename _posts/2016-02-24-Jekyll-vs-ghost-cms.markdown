After 2 years use Ghost cms I try change for Jekyll.
Also find a lot of infromation about setup process. In general the most big plus Jekyll - Github support.

So if you work with github hosting, Jekyll is your choice!
Another one reason for all this process, local deployment and setup process more easy for Jekyll.
Migration process take more than 2 weeks, some refactoring and redesign stuff.
